  "description": "How suitable is a particular area or piece of land for farming? This category helps users understand this. In particular it displays the ‘Agricultural Land Classification’ - a determination of the suitability of the land for agriculture. The five grades are assessed by a consistent set of criteria which include climate, site-specific information and soil quality. Grade 1 is classed as the best quality land, grade 5 being the poorest.",
  "intro": "Knowing the potential of the land is crucial to determining what you can grow, and where. The datasets in this section were chosen to provide insight into the soil and potential for agriculture. This information can be used to identify suitable land for food growing, forestry and horticulture, among others. We aim to add further information about soil and other key characteristics in the future.",
  "outro": "Still haven’t found what you’re looking for? We plan to integrate more soil information in future versions, along with information on historic productivity.
